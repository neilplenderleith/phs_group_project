Increases were seen in all inpatient and day case activity except elective admissions when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter last year. This is most likely due to the return of services following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. However, it should be noted that any changes are based on relatively small numbers, which will impact on the percentage change.

During the pandemic, the Golden Jubilee National Hospital has been broadening its scope of work and has been receiving a lot of new activity from other NHS boards, much of it relating to cancer patients, as well as from different specialties such as: Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT); Gynaecology; Urology; and Women and Newborn and Dental Groupings.","SMR00 completeness (new attendances only) for the NWTC for the quarter ending December 2021 was 100%.

Golden Jubilee National Hospital has previously advised that it significantly reduced non-urgent activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in temporary ward changes and service reconfigurations, which in turn led to less orthopaedic and general inpatient beds, but significantly more temporary available Cardiology inpatient beds. Golden Jubilee National Hospital continues to provide urgent surgical cancer services with surgical cancer patients bedded in various specialities.

During the pandemic, the Golden Jubilee National Hospital has been broadening its scope of work and has been receiving a lot of new activity from other NHS boards, much of it relating to cancer patients, and also from different specialties such as Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT), Gynaecology, Urology, and both the Women and Newborn and Dental groupings."

Large increases have been observed for Geriatric Medicine from April 2019 onwards. NHS Borders has advised that the significant changes being seen in Geriatric Medicine are due to changes in the pathways/model of care for patients, such as additional wards, reduction in average length of stays and the doubling of the bed complement. This has meant that more patients have been transferred to and discharged from Geriatric Medicine. NHS Borders also had an Older People's Assessment Unit pilot running in February and March 2020 with 14 additional beds. In addition, this increased activity could be potentially inflated due to staff not ticking the 'not on medical grounds' box when they transfer care within TrakCare.","SMR00 completeness for NHS Borders (new attendances only) for the quarter ending December 2021 was 100%.

This is most likely due to the return of services following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.

Prior to the pandemic, NHS Borders previously said that it had closed a number of beds over the course of 2018/19 as it progressed work to prevent admissions and care for people at home in line with its transformation programme. NHS Borders also advised that it managed to reduce the length of stay in acute hospital admissions and that occupied bed days have gone down, so occupancy had reduced.

In February and March 2020, NHS Borders set up a new pathway for Geriatric Medicine, and this increased general acute beds. In response to COVID-19, the bed complements changed in general acute wards and general medical wards. 

Large increases have been observed in beds activity for the Mental Health specialties when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter last year.

Data Management has advised that since NHS Forth Valley's move onto TrakCare, there has been an increase in the number of SMR01 records submitted. Data Management informed that this is down to how the system is used. When a patient is moving consultant, a box can be ticked for 'not on medical grounds': if this is not ticked, an additional SMR is generated.

Lorn & Islands Hospital is now reporting Gastroenterology activity as of quarter ending December 2021. Data Management has advised that a locum service started to address the previous lack of service.

NHS Highland has experienced ongoing reporting issues due to the way in which some outpatient clinics are configured in TrakCare. In many cases, these issues have the potential to impact on both SMR00 and ISD(S)1 outpatients reporting, impacting on the national figures published. Although work is ongoing to address these issues, system restrictions within TrakCare mean that there is no functionality available to correct ad hoc clinic templates, nor make retrospective revisions to SMR00 or ISD(S)1 for attendances linked to ad hoc clinics. The ISD(S)1 Card Class 4 activity used in the analysis of return outpatients is essentially based on a snapshot of NHS Highland's position as at the end of each quarter. It should be noted NHS Highland is not in a position to submit revisions to the snapshot until such time as the clinic configuration issues mentioned above are completely resolved.

As part of a local cost improvement project back in January 2019, it was discovered that Dermatology patients seen at Raigmore Hospital's Dermatology Treatment Centre were not being captured in TrakCare. The issue has since been addressed, and the activity has been reported from April 2019 onwards. As highlighted above, NHS Highland is unable to retrospectively report any data prior to April 2019.","Increases were seen in the number of average available staffed beds and percentage occupancy when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter last year.

From April 2020 onwards, large increases have been observed in beds activity for the Infectious Diseases specialty. Data Management has advised that these increases are due to COVID-19 activity and cases being coded under Infectious Diseases.

Decreases in beds activity have been observed within Stracathro Hospital. This is spread across several specialties but particularly in General Medicine, Geriatric Medicine (units other than long stay) and Psychiatry of Old Age specialties. Data Management is currently investigating this with the board to see if this activity is being transferred to other hospitals within NHS Tayside.

Bed occupancy figures from May 2016 to June 2017 are inaccurate due to a system bug in a previous version of a patient management system.  NHS Tayside is unable to correct this issue as it can no longer submit any retrospective information from that historic system as it no longer has access to modify the data held within it."
NHS Western Isles,"SMR01 completeness for NHS Western Isles for the quarter ending December 2021 was 100%.

Decreases were seen in all inpatient and day case activity when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter last year. This is most likely due to the impact of COVID-19 on NHS services. However, it should be noted that any changes are based on relatively small numbers, which will impact on the percentage change.","SMR00 completeness (new attendances only) for NHS Western Isles for quarter ending December 2021 was 100%.

However, it should be noted that any changes are based on relatively small numbers, which will impact on the percentage change.

Decreases were observed in return attendances for the Obstetrics specialty when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter last year. These decreases are due to there being no activity from October 2020 through to July 2021. When this activity started again in July 2021, it was much higher than usual.

Scotland,"Please note that this release includes Scotland going into emergency measures due to COVID-19. During this pandemic, NHS boards, hospitals and healthcare providers have been required to change their normal way of working to manage their COVID-19 response. As such, this is directly impacting on the volume of hospital activity and trends observed over the past couple of years. For example, inpatient and day case activity reduced by 17% when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter of 2019 (pre-pandemic). However, activity levels have generally been recovering from July 2020 onwards, and inpatient and day case activity has increased by over 5% when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter last year.

NHSScotland SMR01 data are estimated to be 98% complete for the quarter ending December 2021. There are some outstanding records yet to be submitted and some data quality issues to be aware of.

Many trends observed will be influenced by (and attributable to) the data completeness levels, small numbers and the impact of COVID-19 highlighted above. Therefore, caution should be taken when comparing quarterly information.","Please note that this release includes Scotland going into emergency measures due to COVID-19.

For example, outpatient activity reduced by 13% when comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter of 2019 (pre-pandemic).

NHSScotland SMR00 data (relating to new attendances only) are estimated to be 98% complete for the quarter ending December 2021. There are some outstanding records yet to be submitted and some data quality issues to be aware of.

Please note that there are a number of NHS boards where the Data Management Team is unable to accurately measure completeness, as coding reports are not received from these NHS boards. The NHS boards affected are Borders, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Highland, Orkney and Shetland. Reported completeness figures may change as more information becomes available.

Many trends observed will be influenced by (and attributable to) the data completeness levels, small numbers and the impact of COVID-19 highlighted above. Therefore, caution should be taken when comparing quarterly information.

The recording of procedures is not consistent across the NHS boards. NHS Borders, NHS Dumfries & Galloway, NHS Grampian, NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Lothian and the NHS island boards (namely NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland and NHS Western Isles) record procedures on under 10% of records submitted. Other NHS boards record procedures on between 10% and 25% of records.

The submission of all return attendances is mandatory, regardless of whether or not a procedure is performed. However, there is variation in the NHS boards' submissions of return outpatients in SMR00. For this reason, ISD(S)1 has been used to extract return outpatient attendances.","Please note that this release includes Scotland going into emergency measures due to COVID-19.

From April 2020 to June 2021, there was a marked increase in the use of the XSU ('Unspecified') specialty across many of the NHS boards. This was most likely due to their COVID-19 response and not allocating beds to specific specialties. From July 2021 onwards, these beds have been returning to similar pre-pandemic levels. 

Records have been identified with potentially duplicate information coming from more than one NHS board for the same location. The numbers concerned are very low and the impact is not significant. Additionally, there are issues with the allocation of NHS hospitals to NHS boards and private hospital activity to the 'Non-NHS Provider' code. Data Management has investigated and found that in many of these cases, this can be attributed to visiting consultant activity and NHS boards sending their patients to private locations."
Unknown Health Board,,"Unknown Health Board' refers to locations or residences that cannot be attributed to any of the other NHS boards. Sharp increases have been observed in this category from April 2020 onwards. For example, new outpatient 'unknowns' increased tenfold when comparing the period January-March 2020 to April-June 2020. The main reason for these increases is the submission of records with 'unknown location' code ('D299N: Location not otherwise coded'). This results in the health board of treatment not being derived. Instead of being allocated to the actual NHS board, the activity is instead categorised against 'Unknown Health Board'.

Increased use of the 'unknown location' code can be attributed to uncertainty in the provision of outpatient clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinics are set up as a mixture of face-to-face, telephone, video link and 'Near Me' appointments. However, this code has been used as a workaround during the pandemic when the location of activity was not known. This made the setting-up of clinics simpler in TrakCare. The unknown location code has been used by several boards, predominantly by NHS Tayside and Borders, although use of the code is decreasing in 2021. New outpatient 'unknowns' have decreased by nearly three-quarters (74%) comparing October-December 2021 to the same quarter in 2020.

Data Management is looking at identifying codes that boards could use to correctly derive the health board of treatment, and the intention is that records already submitted using this code will be recoded.",
